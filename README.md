## Fantasy Football

A simple Ruby on Rails application. 

Tech stack:

* AdminLte2 for Control Panel Template

* Postgres database

* RSpec automation test

## Some assumptions

Because I did this exercise at weekend so I could not clarify a few thing, therefore I made a couple of assumptions:

* User and Player are the same entity

* The exercise mentions `Match` but asks for `Creating and managing games between teams`, so I let the (application) user manage games through matches

## Testing

To test, run `rspec` (96.6% covered)

## Deployment
